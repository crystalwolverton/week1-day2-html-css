            <!--paragraph about myself -->
            <p>Born in Biloxi, MS, I grew up just outside of Dallas, TX in what used to be a tiny nothing town, but is now one of the most prominent cities for highschool sports ball in Texas, Allen, TX.
                My current employer relocated me to Richmond, VA from Dallas to head up the East Coast Business Development operations a year and a half ago.
                I have a live in partner who owns his own design firm, he moved his office to Downtown Richmond. I am also a mom of 3! My youngest still lives at home, he is 13. 
                My older son joined the Airforce last year and is currently stationed in Wichita Falls, TX.  My oldest, my daughter, is attending University of Texas, Dallas. She plans to study medicine.</p>
